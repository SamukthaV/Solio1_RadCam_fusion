# Radar-Camera Fusion for Collision Warning

## Overview
This project, in collaboration with the Technology Innovation Hub on Autonomous Navigation (TiHAN) and Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), focuses on enhancing vehicle safety through radar-camera fusion for collision warning. The system integrates data from radar and cameras to accurately detect and track objects, providing real-time collision alerts.

Developed entirely from scratch, the project encompasses everything from sensor mounting to final real-time implementation, showcasing a comprehensive end-to-end solution. Our in-house developed algorithms for sensor data fusion and collision detection ensure optimized performance in dynamic environments.

This international collaboration underscores our commitment to advancing autonomous navigation technologies, with the aim of making roadways safer. Contributions and feedback from the community are welcome, and detailed guidelines are available for those interested in getting involved.

## Project Highlights
