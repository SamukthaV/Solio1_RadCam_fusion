# Radar-Camera Fusion for Collision Warning

## Overview
This project is a collaborative effort with the Technology Innovation Hub on Autonomous Navigation (TiHAN) and Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) aimed at enhancing vehicle safety. Our system integrates data from radar and cameras to provide accurate, real-time collision warnings, ensuring better object detection and tracking.

## Features
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines radar and camera data for precise object detection.
- **Collision Warning**: Provides timely alerts to prevent potential collisions.
- **From Scratch Implementation**: All components, from sensor mounting to real-time deployment, are developed in-house.

## Project Highlights
- **International Collaboration**: Developed with TiHAN and SMC.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for dynamic environments.
- **Comprehensive Development**: Full-stack implementation, including hardware setup, software development, and system integration.

## Technical Details
- **Sensors Used**: Custom-mounted radar and cameras.
- **Software**: Proprietary algorithms for sensor data fusion and collision detection.
- **Implementation**: End-to-end development covering data acquisition, processing, and alert generation.
